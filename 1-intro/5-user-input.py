user_input = input("Write something and press ENTER: ")
print(f"You wrote: {user_input}")

# Note. All the values that are obtained from the input() are strings.
# If you need to deal with them as integers or other data types you need to cast them.
# For example:

# string_input = input()            # string_input is a string variable.
# integer_input = int(string_input) # integer_input is an integer variable.

# Exercise: write a program that asks for your name and says hello to you.
# For example, "hello Marco!"
