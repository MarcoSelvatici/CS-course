# Sometimes you want your program to behave differently depending on some conditions.
# This behaviour can be done by using if statements.
# An if statement is composed of three parts:
# 1- a condition that can be either True or False.
# 2- some instructions that have to be executed if the condition is True.
# 3- some instructions that have to be executed if the condition is False (optional).
# Let's see an example:

a = 5

if a > 10:                        # 1- Condition: a is bigger than 10.
    print("a is bigger than 10")  # 2- Instruction to execute if True.
else:
    print("a is smaller than 10") # 3- Instruction to execute if False. This part is not necessary.


# Exercise: write some code to test whether a is odd or even.
