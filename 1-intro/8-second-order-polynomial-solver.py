# A second order polynomial is a polynomial like:
# x^2 + 3x + 7
# In this exercise, you have to write a program that asks the user the coefficients
# for the polynomial and then shows its solutions.
# Note you can use the square root by doing: sqrt(...)

from math import sqrt # Needed to use the sqrt function.
