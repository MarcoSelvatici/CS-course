# 1. Complete this code to create a sentence with your name and age. For example:
# "My name is Marco and I am 21 years old."

name =
age =

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# Note the new way I am using to print values of varibles together with other text.
# It works like this:
# f"sometext {variable_name} other text"

# 2. Now create a variable that stores your house address and print a sentence like:
# My name is Marco, I am 21 years old and I live in Via Casola Canina 73.
